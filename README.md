# Machine Learning Exercises

This repo is about activities for implementing techniques and practicing Machine Learning algorithms.

These activities were given in machine learning classes, and tasks that required the implementation of ML's algorithms on the postgraduate degree on the Information Security Residency program at Federal University of Ceara.

There are 2 folders relative to code and data:
- In the data folder, there are some ".csv" files were used on the code. 
- In the code folder, there are scripts with proposed tasks and the execution of the code.
